        <p>Currently all teaching materials are related to the McGill Computer Scientist Summer Camp, for which I lead the games stream.</p>

        <p>As I get the opportunity, I hope to upload various materials that I have used to help teach various courses at McGill, including introduction to programming, computer systems, algorithms 1, and algorithms 2.

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>I'm working on an Unreal Engine 4 game right now!  Progress will be shared in blog posts (when I get to it) and in updates to the project page.  If you're interested in participating, send me an email.</p>
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>My current research projects are in neuroscience.  One of them is the simulation of the growth of neurons, called NeuroDev.

          <p>
            The other is a toolkit for analysing the similarities between neuronal signals, attempting to predict cognitive performance from interneuronal correlations.  It's called Behaviorist, but I'm still hoping to think of a better name.</p>
