Hullo!
Welcome to my personal website.
I'm a developer, and this is where I keep a little collection of my projects and post the occasional tutorial or other bit of teaching material.

If you came here to find a particular tutorial or resource, pop on back over to the home page!
If you're looking for a more thorough list of what I do, you can quickly get to my resume from the pages section.
