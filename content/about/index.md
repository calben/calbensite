Hullo!
Welcome to my personal website.
This is where I keep a little collection of my projects and post the occasional tutorial or other bit of teaching material.

If you came here to find a particular tutorial or resource, pop on back over to the home page!

There should probably be a short history or something actually about me on my "About Me" page, but I can't quite figure out what to put here.
So for now, it's blank.
Hopefully the next time you visit it'll be a little more informative.
