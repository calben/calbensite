    Mr Rifle Bot is part of my Isometric Twin Stick tutorial for Unreal Engine 4, but it's free for use by anybody.
    You can also make it for yourself!
    This is the Y-Bot provided by Mixamo with the Rifle animation set.
    I only include a link to it so that people might easily download it without having to set up the animations and the model themselves.
