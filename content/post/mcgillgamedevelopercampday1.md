## Introduction to Game Camp

Throughout the game development camp stream we will discuss programming as it related to video games both large and small.
General programming is a little different from game development, but you certainly need to know basic programming in order to achieve any sort of game!

## Big Budget Games

Big budget games are massive endeavours.
They are typically done on a complicated gaming engine, such as Unreal Engine, Frostbite, or Anvil, and are developed by teams of hundreds of programmers, graphic designers, 3d artists, etc.
Looking at the below image, you might have a gameplay programmer make a scoring system, an animator else make the animation for someone swinging a sword, a physics programmer to write the physics for the sword hitting a target, a modeler to make the sword, an interface programmer to write the feedback to confirm a hit, etc.

Imagining for a moment we are programming the game, here's some of the stuff we might need:

1. A *list* of all the players
2. A set of *method*'s for getting the information from the player's controllers and moving their characters
3. A collection of *objects* representing everything in the game
4. Algorithms for lighting the scene
5. Drivers for displaying the game world to the player
6. A *loop* that continues the game until the player chooses to quit.

The list goes on!
But note those keywords, they're important.

**Usually** these sorts of games are blockbusters with interesting components and a fun core gameplay.
Lately they rely a lot on multiplayer, which has networking components.

These also go under the name of "indie games."
This type of game means a lot of different things to people.
Let's not get into that too much for now- perhaps during the lecture and discussion session we can talk about it.
What I want to bring to your attention is the difference between the below image of **Limbo** and the above image of **For Honor**.
**For Honor** uses a lot of textures, colors, and models to make a beautiful game.
**Limbo** uses some beautiful art assets, but they're 2D and black and white.


If you want to develop an indie game, you can get together with a friend and do it.
One of the beautiful things about video games is that you can "make a lot using a little."
When you're reading a book, maybe a vivid image of what's happening appears in your head.
When you're playing a game, just a little interaction can make a story that much better.
One popular phone game, **Tap Tap Revenge** involves players tapping their screens along with music- a simple game mechanic that was very enjoyable.

# Our Game

Over the next few days we're developing an AI for the game Space Racer.
Your AI will guide the ship through an asteroid field.

Our schedule consists of the following:

1. Learn basic programming
2. Explore 3D modeling
3. Learn about how different parts of game development fit together
4. Learn basic artificial intelligence for games
5. Hold a competition!
